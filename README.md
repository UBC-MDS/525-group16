# Predicting Daily Rainfall Totals
Group 16: Kiran Phaterpekar, Nikita Shymberg, Margot Vore, and Thea Wenxin

## Goal
Our goal is to build and deploy an ensemble machine learning model that predicts daily rainfall totals in Australia based on climate features. We will be creating the model in AWS and deploying using flask.
